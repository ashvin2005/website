# 🎉 Welcome to Cherry On Tech's Website! 🌟

We are a **tech squad** dedicated to supporting each other as we learn and grow in our tech careers. Our inspiration comes from [Mo Hampton](https://twitter.com/MoxieHampton)'s insightful talk at [JuneteenthConf](https://www.juneteenthconf.com/), titled "[Breaking into Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2N5fI5j-IIs)." Stay tuned for an upcoming blog post to learn more about us!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This website is built using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), a static site generator based on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). While it's still under construction, we love it already, and we hope you do too! ❤️

## 🚀 Installation

To get started with our project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Check your installation by running:
