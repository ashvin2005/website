perspectives:
- meaning: Set product goals, start sprint planning to spread work between different specific teams, and associate sprint goals. Spring teams have daily/weekly scrums where they work or discuss their goals. Finally, a sprint review is done to go over tasks and goals accomplished. Then either goals can be reset or go back into sprint planning if goals were not completed. This is a cycle that continues until the project is finished. 
  role: Any Development Team
